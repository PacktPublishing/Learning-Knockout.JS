## About the Video Course
Among the various JavaScript libraries available to developers, Knockout.JS really stands out due to the diverse features it provides and also because it promotes the use of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to build data-driven web applications. Construct power-packed apps without compromising on its flexibility and build rich user interfaces, which will update in real-time when the data model state changes, eliminating the need to refresh pages.

Learning Knockout.JS will walk you through all of the key features of Knockout.JS and make it easy for you to quickly and easily build feature-and data-rich web applications that are easy to extend and maintain.

 We start off with a brief introduction to Knockout.JS, and its various benefits, and explore the different design patterns in context of Knockout.JS to make your JavaScript code cleaner and more manageable. After that, we will walk through and understand the relationship between Models, Views, and ViewModels, as well as creating them.

Along with that, you will also learn how we can use the different data binding attributes to manipulate the output. We will also discuss and implement various important concepts such as two way data binding and dependency tracking to update your UI in real-time and to separate the components of your application into logical parts.

We will analyze Knockout’s template feature to help you deal with data context in most scenarios. Then, we will take a look at how to track the changes in dependencies and subscribe to them using computed observables and subscriptions. Furthermore, you will also learn how to customize bindings and functions as well as using extenders to create our own set of Knockout tools. Finally, we will take a look at some advanced features of Knockout.JS to take your knowledge to the next level!

Learning Knockout.JS is more than just an introduction; it’s a complete course on one of JavaScript’s innovative libraries.



This course teaches you the key aspects of this flexible data store. You’ll learn how a NoSQL data store such as Redis differs from traditional SQL databases that you may be more familiar with. You’ll see how to install the database on your own machine, or use a database provider in the cloud. You’ll also discover the basic native data types of Redis and how to use them.

From theory to application, Rapid Redis explains when, why, and how to use the Redis data store. We’ll discuss the differences between NoSQL and SQL, explore the Redis data types to see how to use them, and end up with an easy-to-understand Node.js example app that uses Redis as a cache.

No matter what kind of application you’re working on, you need a place to store your data. Rapid Redis gives you a new tool to add to your toolbox: a data store that is quick and easy to use, and far more powerful than you can imagine.
